## Associate your phone number with your alias

### Command

```
voip: <last 3 digits of SIP/...> is <alias>
```

### Example

Suppose your alias is `kimhd` and phone number is 555-222-1212. Look for your phone number in the chat window and get the last 3 digits from the adjacent string `[SIP/xx.xx.xx.xxx-xxxxxxxx]`

```
[09:01] <voip-vctf> 15552221212 [SIP/69.77.77.777-00000174] has joined the conference.
```

The last 3 digits are `174`. You would enter command:

```
voip: 174 is kimhd
```

## Speaking off the record

### Command

```
/me <your message>
```

### Example

```
/me can you speak up please?
```

## List connections

### Command

```
voip: connections?
```

## Scribing

### Command

```
<alias>: <what they said>
```

### Example

Suppose ChristopherA is scribing, and kimhd says "The next thing we will discuss is the DID spec"

ChristopherA would type:
```
kimhd: The next thing we will discuss is the DID spec
```

To continue, and avoid repeating the author name, type `...` (on the new line)

# Publishing the Minutes

This section documents how one can clean up and publish minutes.

At the end of every call, the raw IRC log and audio recording are uploaded to:

* https://w3c-ccg.s3.digitalbazaar.com/minutes/YYYY-MM-DD-irc.log
* https://w3c-ccg.s3.digitalbazaar.com/minutes/YYYY-MM-DD-audio.wav

What follows is how you take those raw files and process them to generate the finalized minutes for the meeting.

## Setup

To publish the minutes, you must have the meetings Github repository checked out. WARNING: This is a very large, multi-gigabyte repository, don't try to download it without a good Internet connection. These instructions should work for Linux and Mac OS X systems.

1. `git clone git@github.com:w3c-ccg/meetings.git w3c-ccg-meetings`
1. `cp publishing.cfg.example publishing.cfg` (setup the text editor and audio editor variables in publishing.cfg)

## Publishing

1. `./download-raw-minutes`
1. `cd <LATEST_MINUTES_DIRECTORY>` (e.g. `cd 2018-01-09`)
1. Edit the WAV file to 1) delete all audio before the Chair starts talking about the Agenda, and 2) delete all audio after the first person hangs up at the end of the call. Basically, clean up the audio to save the content and save the new file as audio.wav or encode to audio.ogg at 32kbps. For example: `oggenc -b 32 audio.wav`
1. Go to https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/scribe-tool/ and copy/paste irc.log into the text input box at the bottom. Clean up the IRC log accordingly and overwrite irc.log with the edited file.
1. `cd ../scribe-tool`
1. `./publish ../<LATEST_MINUTES_DIRECTORY>` (e.g. `./publish ../2018-01-09`)

If there are no errors, the latest minutes should now be published.
